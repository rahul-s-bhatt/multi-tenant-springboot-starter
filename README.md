# spring-boot-starter-multitenancy

An opinionated, pluggable, and production-grade multi-tenant library built using Spring Boot idioms.

## Vision

- Convention over configuration
- Thread-safe, runtime-resolvable tenant context
- Pluggable resolvers, registry, and routing datasource
- Built to scale from POCs to real-world SaaS products

## Status

ðŸš§ Currently in early scaffolding. Everything will be modular, extensible, and battle-ready.
