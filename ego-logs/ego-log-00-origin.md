Got Rs. 41 / per day as apprisal today even after doing extra weekends, infra and devops related things because management couldn't provide proper resources.
I feel like lowest of the low, right now.
4 yoe and I even handled team as an RM for 2 years.

Said just "okay" when he said the numbers and didn't even fight back.

But I want to change, I want to score myself.

Does your effort truly matter?
Does your team work truly matter?
Does your self sacrifice truly matter?

isagi yoichi, thank you for teaching me about ego.
