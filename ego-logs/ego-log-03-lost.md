Not able to work right now due to no motivation to do anything, almost lost the vision of the project.
It feels pointless to even move forward. This looks like the first game of Team Z when they lost 5 - 1.

Even though I survived two or three days of ego-lock, I don't know if I will be able to survive more.

I need to train my brain to work despite above feelings but the problem is that my thinking patterns gets affected heavily.

Okay, I had removed everything from starter and started fresh.
