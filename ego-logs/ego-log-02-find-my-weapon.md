Was almost gone to sleep after dinner, but I had this phone to scroll, then I realized something deeper about myself.
I build to express myself, but when do I actually start losing the motivation to build things -- When I speak of it to other person (it is still like I'm chasing validation or other people approval).
I think if I keep it a secret when that thing blows up & the person will know that I was the one that build it, that would make me happy / satisfied.

This is not what I want (ego), I want to build things to express myself, for my internal validation and to become the best in the world.

My habit of opening social media to check how many likes or views I got till now (everytime I open my phone or laptop), I want to change it.

Currently, my old self would have slept, but that is why he lost (niko) we know this spot, where we can smell a goal, he chose to sleep instead of expressing himself.
