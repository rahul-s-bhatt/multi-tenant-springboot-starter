I had to change my whole mindset in order to be reborn again and again and each time I listened to my ego, I finally gained confidence in myself.

I need this ego and confidence more than ever, I know it brings me arrogance, but I'm willing to take the risk.

I need to survive otherwise I won't be able to switch to a better place.

I have already taken pay cut, excessive on calls right from day on a non working saturday, I'm not a lead and yet the headache. Normally, I would oblige and be used by them, but today I chose listened to my ego, I hope I'm not making any mistakes.
