We are gonna build dual data source switching (the one I build for my company, reason was one data source would be used for master tenant, other data source would for all the other tenants -- via abstract routing multi tenant datasource).

do you understand this?

The way it was achieved is that--there were two classes having 
enable jpa repositories which has 3 parameters:
- basePackages
- entitymanagerfactoryref
- transactionmanagerref

3 methods to create 3 beans:
- datasource bean 
- entitymanagerfactory bean 
- platform transaction manager bean

how did I separate those two at entity & repository level?
- entity scan, packages, persistence unit name.

The one line which actually solved spring not picking the entities in other packages was:

when creating entity manager ref:

entityManagerFactoryBean.getJPAProperyMap().put(AvailableSettings.BEAN_CONATINER, new SpringConatiner(beanfactory))

that line was found on stackoverflow after 2-3 weeks of just trying.


Do you understand what I want, please come up with the structure...
